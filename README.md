# Organisr

(idk put some images here)

## Concept
Organisr is an elegant way to take notes for storage. It would be extremely useful for those with a lot of items, specifically small ones. The app allows users to create 'boxes' which represent real life storage containers and add their items. Then, when they want to search for a specific item, they can use the search function to find the location of the item.

## Functions/To Add
Basic functions
   - create boxes and add items [ ]
   - search [ ]

<br>

Expanding functions
   - advanced settings like images and expiry date, etc [ ]
   - visual to differenciate boxes (eg, boxes with more items are more blue) [ ]
   - image search, if possible [ ]
   - siri integration (how??) [ ]
   - themes [ ]

## Developement

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
