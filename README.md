# Organisr ðŸ“¦ðŸ“¦ðŸ“¦

(idk put some images here)

## Concept
Organisr is an elegant way to take notes for storage. It would be extremely useful for those with a lot of items, specifically small ones. The app allows users to create 'boxes' which represent real life storage containers and add their items. Then, when they want to search for a specific item, they can use the search function to find the location of the item.

## Story
Being really bad at storing items, I was often scolded and well, most frequently, I would forget where I have stored the item and fail to find the item. The idea is from a short. It was a tips video, and one of them was about using notes to record places of items.

Whenever I try to find something but its hidden somewhere,... deep and never-to-be-seen, I always think: *my life would be so much better if I had airtags on everything lol.* Though airtags for everything are definitely out of reach (as of now), but this is the alternative!

I thought that it would be really useful to have an app dedicated to storage, it'd feature more advanced capabilities such as adding images, remarks, AI searching, filters and more. Everything can be put into 'boxes' and moved around to other boxes. For example, there could be a 'box' for the bottom most layer of your snack trolley so you would never miss an expiry date! Or you could also add unused items, so that whenever you want to find them, it would be easy as a small search in the app! Though there are some issues, for example too many items would take a very long time to add (btw users can snap a pic of the box and attach it too >w<), in which I will try my best to improve!

## Developement
After you fork and clone the repository... (from original README)

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a
